                In [[anatomy]], the '''head''' of an [[animal]] is the [[rostral]] part (from [[anatomical]] position)
                that usually comprises the [[brain]], [[eye]]s, [[ear]]s, [[nose]], and [[mouth]] (all of which aid in
                various sensory functions, such as [[sight]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[olfaction|smell]], and
                [[taste]]). Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetric
                forms]] do.

                ==Cultural importance==
                For humans, the head and particularly the face are the main distinguishing feature between different
                people, due to their easily discernible features such as hair and eye color, nose, eye and mouth shapes,
                wrinkles, etc. However, human faces may seem easily differentiable to us only because we are so familiar
                with them; when observing a relatively unfamiliar species, all faces seem to be nearly identical.
                Additionally, human infants are biologically programmed to recognize subtle differences in human faces.

                People who are more [[intelligent]] than normal are sometimes depicted in [[cartoon]]s as having bigger
                heads, as a way of indicating that they have a larger brain; in [[science fiction]], an
                [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] having a big head is often symbolic of
                high intelligence. Outside of this symbolic depiction, however, advances in neurobiology have shown that
                the functional diversity of the brain means that a difference in overall brain size is not a reliable
                indicator of how much, if any, difference in overall intelligence exists between two humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=neurosci.box.1833
                Brain Size and Intelligence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

                The head is a source for many metaphors and metonymies in human language, including referring to things
                which are often located near the human head ( "the head of the bed"), things which are physically
                similar to the way an animal's (or human's) head is arranged spatially vis-a-vis its body ("the head of
                the table"), even if this is so metaphorically ("the head of the class/FBI"), and things which represent
                some characteristic we associate with the head, such as intelligence ("there are a lot of good heads in
                this company"). These examples are all from English, but only some are possible expressions in other
                languages (depending on the language). (See Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 1999)

                ==Clothing==
                In many cultures, covering the head is seen as a sign of respect. Often, some or all of the head must be
                covered and veiled when entering holy places, or places of prayer. For many centuries, women in Europe,
                the Middle East, and South Asia have covered their hair as a sign of modesty. This trend has changed
                drastically in Europe in the 20th century, although is still observed in other parts of the world. In
                addition, a number of religious paths require men to wear specific head clothingsuch as the Jewish
                [[yarmulke]], or the Sikh turban; or Muslim women, who cover their hair, ears, and neck with a scarf.

                Different headpieces can also signify status, origin, religious/spiritual beliefs, social grouping,
                occupation, and fashion choices.

                ==Anatomy generally==
                ===Bilateral symmetry===
                The very simplest animals do not have a head, but many [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetric forms]] do.
                [[Vertebrates]] in particular have distinctive heads, which is associated with the development of the
                [[neural crest]] in the developing vertebrate embryo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Gee]].
                "[http://www.nature.com/news/2000/000810/full/news000810-1.html Getting a head]", ''[[Nature
                (journal)|Nature]]'', [[2000-08-04]]&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the vertebrate head are protected by an
                enclosure of [[bone]] called the [[skull]], which is attached to the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]]. The head
                is the most complex anatomical construct in the anatomy of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/history/vet_anat/
                University of Cambridge's Veterinary Anatomy webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

                The head is of singular importance as it contains the [[brain]], the nerve center in animals.
